Info: emif.emif_fm_0.arch: Agilex EMIF IP requires EMIF Calibration IP to source its calbus clock and calbus conduit.
Info: emif.emif_fm_0.arch: PHY and controller running at 2x the frequency of user logic for improved efficiency.
Info: emif.emif_fm_0.arch: Placement of address/command pins must follow "DDR4 Scheme 2: Component and DIMM".
Info: emif.emif_fm_0.arch: Interface estimated to require 1 I/O Bank(s) and 2 I/O PLL(s). This is only an estimation. Final usage depends on user pin location assignments and/or fitter behavior.
Info: emif.emif_fm_0.arch: Valid memory frequencies for the current PLL reference clock of 300.0 MHz and user clock rate, in MHz: 1200.0
Info: emif.emif_fm_0.arch: For additional documentation about the interface, consult the *_readme.txt file after generation.
